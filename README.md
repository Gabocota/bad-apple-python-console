# bad-apple-python-console
Print any video into the python console (preferably bad apple)

You can put any mp4 video into the folder and run it. Just make sure to set the fps to what it is in case it isn't 30.

If the process doesn't end and you want to change the source delete: folder frames and the audio and video files.
